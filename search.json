Observational Studies\nDefinition: Researchers observe choices or outcomes without assigning treatments.\n\nRetrospective: Looking at past data (e.g., examining hospital records of jeepney drivers for respiratory issues).\nProspective: Following subjects into the future (e.g., tracking a cohort of BPO workers for 5 years to see health effects of night shifts).\n\n\nExample: “Does eating ‘Unli-Rice’ cause diabetes?” If we just survey people, we can only find an association, not a cause."

Keep conditions the same (e.g., same amount of garlic, same cooking time, same pot type).\nRandomize: Equalize the effects of unknown variation. E.g. Randomly assign which judge tastes which Adobo to average out bias (e.g., judge’s mood).\nReplicate: Use enough subjects so differences aren’t just anecdotes. E.g. Use many judges (n=50), not just one “Tita”.\nBlock: Group similar subjects together before randomizing. E.g. Group judges by preference first. (e.g., “Visayans” vs “Tagalogs” might have different taste preferences, so we block by region)."

Confounding\nThe Enemy of Inference.\nWhen the levels of one factor are associated with the levels of another factor, we cannot separate their effects.\n\nExample: Testing a new teaching method only in the morning. Is it the method or the time of day?\nRandomization is the cure for confounding.\n\nAnother Example\n“Board Exam Review Centers”\nStudents who enroll in expensive Review Centers have higher passing rates. * Is it the center? Or is it because those students have more money (better nutrition/books) and more free time (don’t need to work)? * Socio-economic status is confounding the result."

Observation is like a survey (Unli-rice usage); Experiment is an intervention (Adobo cooking test).\nComponents: Remember that Treatments are the specific combinations of Factor Levels. E.g. Treatments are the specific recipes (Factor Combinations).\nThe Big Four: Valid experiments must Control, Randomize, Replicate, and Block. E.g. Control (ingredients), Randomize (tasters), Replicate (sample size), Block (region).\nConfounding: We Randomize to ensure that confounding variables are spread equally across groups. E.g. without randomization, other factors (like wealth in the Review Center example) confuse our results."
